        <h2>MST - Lead UI/UX/Product Designer (2012 â€” 2018, 6 years 7 months)</h2>
        <p>MST (the main customers are Sony, PepsiCo, WimmBillDann, Jacobs) is a set of three b2b applications, several admin sites, and dashboards for showing statistics. This is a SaaS for organizations with field employees, regularly visiting customers for stock checkout, merchandising on the shelves, control of promos, and other marketing activities. I've been working on the project from the very beginning to its growth stage.</p>
        <p>The first steps for the company were to understand the user and stakeholder needs. Fortunately, we had direct access to the working teams of merchandisers and their team leaders, so we could conduct direct user testing, surveys, CustDev, and identify problems at an early stage. Starting working with a product that combines several applications, admin sites, dashboards, and so on, I understood that we needed to build a design system.</p>
        <p>We were based on the theory of Atomic Design and the best practices of the Design Language System used in Airbnb.</p>

        <h3>Survey constructor</h3>
        
        <p>One of the important tasks was to allow team leaders to made customized surveys for merchandisers. So as a Product designer I  decided to make a Survey Constructor. It becomes one of the main competitive advantages of our project. Please take a look at a short video of creating a new survey:</p>
